"The first attention in man is animal awareness, which has been
 developed, through the process of experience, into a complex, intricate,
 and extremely fragile faculty that takes care of the day-to-day world
 in all its innumerable aspects. ; In other words, everything that one can
 think about is part of the first attention."

"Perception takes place because there is in each of us an agent called
 the assemblage point that selects internal and external emanations for
 alignment. ; The particular alignment that we perceive as the world is
 the product of the specific spot where our assemblage point is located
 on our cocoon."

 undergoes in sleep. ; To control that shift does not mean in any way to

 it naturally moves in sleep."

 awareness."

"In the universe there is an unmeasurable, indescribable force which
 sorcerers call intent, and absolutely everything that exists in the
 entire cosmos is attached to intent by a connecting link. ; Sorcerers,
 or warriors, are concerned with discussing, understanding, and employing
 that connecting link. ; They are especially concerned with cleaning it
 of the numbing effects brought about by the ordinary concerns of their
 everyday lives. ; Sorcery at this level could be defined as the procedure
 of cleaning one's connecting link to intent."

 connection that exists between intent and all sentient beings. ; 
 Sorcerers call intent the indescribable, the spirit, the abstract,
 the nagual."

"Every act performed by sorcerers is either performed as a way to
 strengthen their link with intent or as a response triggered by the
 link itself. ; Sorcerers, therefore, have to be actively and permanently
 on the lookout for manifestations of the spirit. ; Such manifestations
 are called gestures of the spirit or, more simply, indications or omens."

"Self-importance is the force generated by man's self-image. ; It is
 that force which keeps the assemblage point fixed where it is at
 present. ; For this reason, the thrust of the warriors' way is to
 dethrone self-importance. ; And everything sorcerers do is toward
 accomplishing this goal."

 stages. ; The first is when he has a rusty, untrustworthy link with intent. ;

 to manipulate it. ; And the fourth is when he learns to accept the designs
 of the abstract."

"Look at it this way: At least once, as sperms, each one of us fought a battle for life - a unique struggle against millions of other competitors - and we won! And now the battle continues, since we are trapped by the forces of this world. One part of us is fighting to disintegrate  and  die,  while another tries to maintain life and awareness at any cost. There is no peace! A warrior realizes this, and uses it to his advantage. His goal continues to be that which inspired the spark of life that created him: Access to a new level of awareness."

For a warrior, to be harmonious is to flow, not to stop in the middle of the current and try to make a space  of  artificial  and impossible peace. He knows that he can only give the very best of himself under conditions of maximum tension. For that reason, he seeks out his opponent the way a fighting rooster does - with avidity, with delight, knowing that the next step is decisive. His opponent  is  not his fellow man, but his own attachments and weaknesses, and his grand challenge is to compress the layers of his energy until they won't expand when his life ceases, so that his awareness does not die.
